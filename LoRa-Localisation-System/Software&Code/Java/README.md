the Jar file is too big for github and i split it to 3 file  
The [eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/) is used for the programing of java 
two libr are used in this program, [The Apache Commons Mathematics Library](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/) & [Apache POI](https://poi.apache.org/)  
to modify the program and build again, put the jar files to **lib** folder of java and include the jar to the build path  
**LoRaLocalization** is the folder of the projcet in eclipse, u can modify it and generate the Jar file to run the application
